One step ahead is always a win. After exploring HTML, CSS, JS i decided to dive in the world 
of 3js and it's so cool. While the implementation of a 3d animation using 3js requires NPM node.js 
local server setup, a project as minor as a spinning cube can be deployed without hosting a local server 
which i've created right here. this is so because three can't be imported through cdn and requires npm setup for import and fine working however a spinning cube requires basic setup of scene, camera and rendering, hence i was build it. 

have a look at it:

World of Development is treating me well ig.
