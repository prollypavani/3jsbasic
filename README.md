One step ahead is always a win. After exploring HTML, CSS, JS i decided to dive in the world 
of 3js and it's so cool. While the implementation of a 3d animtion using 3js requires NPM node.js 
local server setup, a project as minor as a spinning cube can be deployed without hosting a local server 
which i've created right here.

World of Development is treating me well ig.
